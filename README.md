# Energy Efficiency of Buildings (Green Building Analysis)

This project is part of my Edunet X Shell internship, where I am analyzing the energy efficiency of buildings using machine learning.  
The objective is to understand how building design parameters influence heating and cooling loads, and to develop models that can guide sustainable and energy-efficient building designs.

## Week 1

- Defined the problem statement and project scope  
- Collected and explored the dataset (**ENB2012_data.xlsx**)  
- Preprocessed the data (renamed columns, checked missing values, scaled features)  
- Created feature distribution plots and a correlation heatmap to study relationships  
- Plotted **Relative Compactness vs Heating Load** to visualize its impact on energy efficiency  
- Split the dataset into **Train, Validation, and Test sets** for future modeling

## Why this matters
Heating and cooling are the largest contributors to building energy consumption.  
By identifying how features like compactness, surface area, wall area, and glazing ratio affect these loads, we can draw insights to design buildings that consume less energy while maintaining comfort.  
The visualizations from Week 1 already show patterns, such as compact buildings needing less heating energy, which supports sustainable architectural choices.

## Upcoming Weeks

I will continue with:  
- Algorithm selection (Regression models, Decision Trees, etc.)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Model optimization and deployment
