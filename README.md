# Energy Efficiency of Buildings (Green Building Analysis)

This project is part of my Edunet X Shell internship where I am analyzing the energy efficiency 
of buildings using machine learning.

## Week 1
- Defined the problem statement
- Collected and explored the dataset (ENB2012_data.xlsx)
- Preprocessed the data (renamed columns, checked missing values, scaled features)
- Split the dataset into Train, Validation, and Test sets

## Upcoming Weeks
I will continue with:
- Algorithm selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Model optimization and deployment
